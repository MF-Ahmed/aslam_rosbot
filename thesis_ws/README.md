Thesis WS
============

This branch refers to a new implementation of the coordination algorithm in which the robots do not wait for all the other agents before being directed to a goal. They work on the merged points but in an asynchronous way. <br>
Refer to [this](https://github.com/mmatteo-hub/thesis_ws/tree/karto_slam) branch for the program launch
